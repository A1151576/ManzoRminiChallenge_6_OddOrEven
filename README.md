This program works well and does everything that is required in the assignment. It makes sure that whatever the user inputs is a number before telling the user if 
the number is odd or even. It then allows the user to restart the program by typing in any character or end the program by typing no. I would recommend adding a command
like .ToUpper() or .ToLower() to make sure that if the user types 'no' like NO or No, that their input is correctly read and the program will be ended correctly.
